Oryx is a genus consisting of four large antelope species called oryxes. Their pelage is pale with contrasting dark markings in the face and on the legs, and their long horns are almost straight. The exception is the scimitar oryx, which lacks dark markings on the legs, only has faint dark markings on the head, has an ochre neck, and has horns that are clearly decurved.

The Arabian oryx was only saved from extinction through a captive-breeding program and reintroduction to the wild.The scimitar oryx, which is now listed as extinct in the wild, also relies on a captive-breeding program for its survival.
