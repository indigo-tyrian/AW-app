Agalychnis callidryas, or better known as the red-eyed tree frog, is an arboreal hylid native to Neotropical rainforests where it ranges from Mexico, through Central America, to Colombia. The scientific name of the red-eyed treefrog, A. callidryas, comes from the Greek words kalos (meaning "beautiful") and dryas (a "tree" or "wood nymph").

This species has large, bright red eyes with vertically narrowed pupils. The red eyed tree frog is very colorful, with a vibrant green body, yellow and blue vertical stripes along its side, a white underside, brightly colored red or orange feet, and red eyes. Additionally, they have sticky pads on their toes that allow them to cling onto leaves . The skin on the red eyed treefrog's belly is soft and fragile, whereas the back is thicker and rougher. On average, the males are about two inches long, and the females are slightly bigger at around 3 inches.
