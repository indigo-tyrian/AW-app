## The forest was not a place to go for refreshment

      
In the world we live in today, "forests" are something to protect and preserve!


For medieval people, however, "forest" had a completely different meaning.


For medieval people, forests were a source of firewood, timber for construction, fodder for livestock, honey, and other essentials for daily life, but they were also sacred places and unknown spaces.

The Other World Closest to Us

For medieval people, the world was divided into unknown spaces (sacred spaces) and known spaces (secular spaces).


Known spaces were places where people lived, such as houses, cities, and villages. Once one steps out of a city or village, there is an unknown space.


It was believed that the unknown space had immeasurable power, various forces that affect all human lives, and that happiness, misfortune, luck, bad luck, war, bad harvests, disasters, etc. all come from the unknown space. The forest was the unknown space closest to humans.


Sorry for those of you who don't know Harry Potter, but for medieval people, the forest is exactly what the Forbidden Forest on the grounds of Hogwarts feels like.

It is a very scary place, pitch black and inhabited by mysterious creatures. Wolves can be heard howling from time to time.


To ward off disasters and "unknown" things that come from such a forest, an "artificial" bell in the church was rung.


  What is a virgin forest?
Here, some of you who are reading this text may be thinking, "I have actually been to a forest, or seen a forest on TV or on the Internet, and it wasn't scary at all, right?" Some of you may be thinking, "I have actually been to a forest or seen a forest on TV or the Internet, and it was not scary at all.


However, the places that come to mind when we hear the word "forest" or have visited are not forests that have not been touched by humans, but forests that have been touched by humans. Forests that have not been touched by humans are called virgin forests.


In forests that have been modified by humans, the spacing between trees is adjusted and branches are cut so that sunlight can reach close to the ground. The trees themselves have been bred to grow straight so that they can be used easily as lumber.


In contrast, virgin forests, which are untouched by human hands, are densely populated with trees with unlimited growth of branches and crooked trunks. These trees cover the sky, making it dark and eerie even during the daytime.

The primeval forest was not a place to go all the way to refresh yourself, but a place you would want to leave as soon as possible, just like a human-managed forest.


Incidentally, it is said that today in Japan there are less than 4% of the country's virgin forests that have not been touched by humans at all.

Christianity and Deforestation

Later, Christianity gradually became more and more strongly held, and the idea that the world is divided into unknown and known spaces disappeared. It does not recognize the existence of unknown space, but rather that space is one and all is for human beings.


Until then, people had been getting only what they needed from the forests, but after the spread of this idea, the forests were cut down excessively.
