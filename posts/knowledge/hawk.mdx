## A hawk, mosquito and DDT
      
Since the 1950s, a chemical called "DDT" has been sprayed in large quantities in areas where infections were spreading in order to control the mosquitoes that transmit yellow fever and malaria.


DDT is a drug used primarily as a pesticide and insecticide. It is known for its high toxicity to organisms, but also for its resistance to decomposition.

DDT â†’ Hawk


DDT is not easily degraded, so if an organism eats food containing DDT, it will stay in the organism for a long time and have a negative effect on it.


Hawks are at the top of the food chain and have a longer life span than other organisms. Therefore, hawks living in areas where DDT has been sprayed have suffered from DDT bioaccumulation, a disease that causes their eggshells to crack easily.

Bioaccumulation



Bioaccumulation is a phenomenon in which a substance is concentrated in the body of an organism through the food chain in an ecosystem.


In this case, the DDT-containing grass, insects, small animals and birds, hawks, and so on.




The number of hawks in the area where DDT was sprayed was rapidly decreasing.


However, the number of people infected with yellow fever and malaria, which had decreased thanks to DDT, increased again.


Today, the use of DDT is regulated in most countries, but if it is difficult to obtain an alternative insecticide to DDT, DDT may be used.


Mosquitoes resistant to DDT have already been identified, and some people have asked, "Wouldn't spraying with DDT only have a temporary effect?" Some say, "Spraying with DDT may only have a temporary effect.


Even if one side is solved, other bad things will happen.


This conflict is something we feel all the time in our daily life, work, and relationships, and it also applies to the larger course of history.
