      <h1 >A hawk, mosquit and DDT</h1>
      <p>
        Since the 1950s, a chemical called "DDT" has been sprayed in large quantities in areas where infections were spreading in order to control the mosquitoes that transmit yellow fever and malaria.
      </p>
      <p>
        DDT is a drug used primarily as a pesticide and insecticide. It is known for its high toxicity to organisms, but also for its resistance to decomposition.

        DDT â†’ Hawk
      </p>
      <p>
        DDT is not easily degraded, so if an organism eats food containing DDT, it will stay in the organism for a long time and have a negative effect on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hawks are at the top of the food chain and have a longer life span than other organisms. Therefore, hawks living in areas where DDT has been sprayed have suffered from DDT bioaccumulation, a disease that causes their eggshells to crack easily.

        Bioaccumulation
      </p>
      <p>

        Bioaccumulation is a phenomenon in which a substance is concentrated in the body of an organism through the food chain in an ecosystem.

      <p>
        In this case, the DDT-containing grass, insects, small animals and birds, hawks, and so on.

      </p>
      <p>

        The number of hawks in the area where DDT was sprayed was rapidly decreasing.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the number of people infected with yellow fever and malaria, which had decreased thanks to DDT, increased again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, the use of DDT is regulated in most countries, but if it is difficult to obtain an alternative insecticide to DDT, DDT may be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mosquitoes resistant to DDT have already been identified, and some people have asked, "Wouldn't spraying with DDT only have a temporary effect?" Some say, "Spraying with DDT may only have a temporary effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if one side is solved, other bad things will happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        This conflict is something we feel all the time in our daily life, work, and relationships, and it also applies to the larger course of history.
