      <h1 >Abeaver is fish</h1>
      <p>
        The concept of the beaver being a fish became popular among Roman Catholics during the Middle Ages.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why did Roman Catholics promote this notion?
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the traditional Catholic tradition, there are many fasting events.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, during the 40-day period between Carnival &#40;Carnival&#41; and Easter &#40;Easter&#41; in February and March &#40;called Lent&#41;, we fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, every Friday is a fasting day because Friday is the day of Christ&#39;s death. &#40;It is said that Jesus Christ was executed on Friday and resurrected three days later on Sunday.&#41;
      </p>
      <p>
        Fasting does not mean that we are not allowed to eat anything. We stop feasting and reduce the frequency and quantity of our food.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meat, and foods of animal origin such as milk, cheese, butter, and eggs, were forbidden during the fast. Instead, fish was allowed to be eaten.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why did they fast?
      </h2>
      <p>
        It was to experience Christ&#39;s suffering for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ willingly crucified Himself on the cross to save mankind from sin. Fasting is a painful practice, but by fasting, we are reminded of Christ&#39;s sacrifice and suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also believed that by suppressing their cravings, they were learning self-control like Christ, and thus drawing a little closer to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for Roman Catholics, who love meat, the ban on meat was very painful.

        I still want to eat meat! I want meat every day, no matter what it takes!

        Beavers were the target. Beavers are members of the rodent family and live around rivers, lakes, and ponds. They can also swim in water.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 17th century, a bishop said.
      </p>
      <p>
        A bishop asked, &#34;Is it correct to say that a beaver is a fish because it swims in water and its tail is shaped like a fin?&#34;
        &#34;So we can eat it during the Passion Passion, right?&#34;
      </p>
      <p>
        He said, &#34;So, we can eat it during the Passion Passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the church heard this, they said, &#34;Well, that&#39;s right.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#34;Well, you are right.
      </p>
      <p>
        The church was like, &#34;Well, that&#39;s right. &#40;Hey!&#41;
      </p>

      <p>

        So the beaver was made into a &#34;fish&#34; to fill the stomachs of those who were fasting.
