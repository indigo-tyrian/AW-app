      <p>
        The concept of the beaver being a fish became popular among Roman Catholics during the Middle Ages.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why did Roman Catholics promote this notion?
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the traditional Catholic tradition, there are many fasting events.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, during the 40-day period between Carnival (Carnival) and Easter (Easter) in February and March (called Lent), we fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, every Friday is a fasting day because Friday is the day of Christ's death. (It is said that Jesus Christ was executed on Friday and resurrected three days later on Sunday.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Fasting does not mean that we are not allowed to eat anything. We stop feasting and reduce the frequency and quantity of our food.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meat, and foods of animal origin such as milk, cheese, butter, and eggs, were forbidden during the fast. Instead, fish was allowed to be eaten.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why did they fast?
      </h2>
      <p>
        It was to experience Christ's suffering for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ willingly crucified Himself on the cross to save mankind from sin. Fasting is a painful practice, but by fasting, we are reminded of Christ's sacrifice and suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also believed that by suppressing their cravings, they were learning self-control like Christ, and thus drawing a little closer to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for Roman Catholics, who love meat, the ban on meat was very painful.
      </p>

      <p>
        I still want to eat meat! I want meat every day, no matter what it takes!
      </p>
      <p>
        Beavers were the target. Beavers are members of the rodent family and live around rivers, lakes, and ponds. They can also swim in water.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 17th century, a bishop said.
      </p>
      <p>
        A bishop asked, "Is it correct to say that a beaver is a fish because it swims in water and its tail is shaped like a fin?"
        "So we can eat it during the Passion Passion, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
        He said, "So, we can eat it during the Passion Passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the church heard this, they said, "Well, that's right.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, you are right.
      </p>
      <p>
        The church was like, "Well, that's right. (Hey!)
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="" />
      <p>

        So the beaver was made into a "fish" to fill the stomachs of those who were fasting.
